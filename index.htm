      <h1>About</h1>
      Welcome to BetaOnline, a Minecraft server that is aiming to strike a balance between nostalgia and modern. We offer a semi-vanilla and old-school feel, with no big game-changing plugins, and no mods of any kind. We have simple rules and you can do pretty much anything you want, as long as it doesn't bother anyone else.
    <p>hello</p>
