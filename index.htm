        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome to BetaOnline, a Minecraft server that is aiming to strike a<br>
          balance between nostalgic and modern Minecraft. We offer a semi-vanilla<br>
          and old-school feel, with no big game-changing plugins, and no mods of any<br>
          kind. We have simple rules and you can do pretty much anything you want, as<br>
          long as it doesn't bother anyone else.</p>
          
        <p>To combat cheaters and griefers, new players who join are not able to build.<br>
           You need to apply for building permission. This is fairly easy, just fill out<br>
           the form at the top of this page, and the server owner will have a look.</p>
