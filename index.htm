        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome to BetaOnline, a Minecraft server that is aiming to strike a<br>
          balance between nostalgic and modern Minecraft. We offer a semi-vanilla<br>
          and old-school feel, with no big game-changing plugins, and no mods of any<br>
          kind. We have simple rules and you can do pretty much anything you want, as<br>
          long as it doesn't bother anyone else.</p>
          
        <p><b>Update 29/03/22:</b> To combat cheaters and griefers, a whitelist has been<br>
        added. Apply for membership of the server by filling out the form that is linked<br>
        on top of this page.</p>
        
        <p><b>Update 16/04/22:</b> To further combat the low quality of players, the server<br>
        has become invite-only. To be able to join the server, you need to know somebody on<br>
        the server to get an invite.</p>
        
        <p><b>Update 25/08/22:</b> The server is now public again. The building permission<br>
        system is back, so be sure to apply using our form.</p>
