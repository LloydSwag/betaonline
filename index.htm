        <p>Betaonline is a Minecraft beta 1.7.3 server that is aiming to strike a balance between nostalgic old Minecraft and more modern Minecraft. We offer a semi-vanilla and old-school feel, with no major game-altering plugins. We have simple rules and you can do pretty much anything you want, as long as you don't bother anyone else.</p>
        
        <p>Betaonline has been running since March 2022, with no world resets. Approximately 2000 unique players have visited us over the last few years. We are also one of the few servers with extensive documented history and lore, which can be read on our wiki.</p>
